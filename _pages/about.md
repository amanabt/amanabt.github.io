<p>
Hello there! Glad to see you here!
</p>

<p>
I am a professional working in the field of high precision scientific instrumentation
used for both characterisation and synthesis primarily in the field of device fabrication
and characterisation with a team of enthusiastic scientists and professionals led by
Prof. Deshdeep Sahdev (Board Member Department of Science and Technology, Retd. IIT Kanpur).
</p>

<p>
I have more than six years of experience in the field of testing and designing of
electronics and PCBs for high speed data acquisition systems and high precision instrumentation,
coding for embedded systems for both AVR and ARM based MCUs, GUI design, CAD modeling, 
writing GPU accelerated computational codes, development of test benches and protocols for
production and testing organisation, optics, and all stages of product development and manufacturing
life cycle.
</p>

<p>
In recent past I, along with my colleague Dr. Krishnendu Chatterjee, have led the development
of novel methods for synthesis of 2 dimensional Transition Metal Di-Chalcogenides (TMDCs),
in particular Molybdenum Disulphide through CVD synthesis, and Graphene, a hot topic among
researchers for development of flexible electronics among several other applications.
</p>

<p>
It is my passion to push the scientific research forward in India through a wholistic approach
which includes instrumentation, experimentation, computation, and theory and make science
more approachable to the general population. Of course, as I move ahead in life, passion
will be more well defined, but the general direction will remain the same.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I enjoy and love doing my work, but, to live my life to the fullest I believe that
one needs to focus on his hobbies as well. Keeping that in mind, I make sure that I have hobbies
through which I can keep my life fun, engaging, and learning. I have several hobbies which I
like to follow from time to time, like, I enjoy playing piano, long distance cycling, visiting
historical monuments, trekking, reading novels, blogging (check it out here!), and swimming.
