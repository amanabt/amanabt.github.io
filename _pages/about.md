<p>
 I am a student undergraduate doing majors in Physics and minors in        
 English Literature from IIT Kanpur. I have several hobbies,
 like, singing, swimming, and playing Bansuri(not to be confused with Venu,
 Indian Classical) and piano(Western Classical compositions). I also
 enjoy going on long-distance cycling trips, reading novels, and writing poems.
</p>
 
<p>
  I also like to challenge myself. In the past I have taken challenges
  like reading 50 books in a year, learning a language to a
  certain extent, etc., which I have managed to finish.
</p>
 
<p>
  I am also learning a few languages these days. I am focusing mainly on
  French as of now, but apart from that I am also trying to learn
  Bangla and Telugu.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  This year also I have taken a challenge to read 50 books, but I am
  hoping to push it to 60 or more. Apart from this I am also trying to
  get  disciplined, by doing a set of activities daily. They include practicing
  piano, practicing French, running and workouts, and studying.
  I am hoping to achieve a good streak in doing these activities.
